# Symphony, Keep Grooving
Symphony is a Music Player coded in Python for the semester project of Programming and Problem Solving course of my undergrad curriculum.
This was a group project.

The libraries and modules used for making this project are:
1. Tkinter library for creating GUI elements.
2. Pygame.mixer which is a pygame module for loading and playing sounds.
3. Mutagen module for handling audio metadata.
4. TTkthemes which is a group of themes for the ttk extentions for tkinter.
